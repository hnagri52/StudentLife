# StudentLife

## Inspiration
When we came to this Hackathon, it was very hard finding a team. When we all came together, we decided that other students attending future hackathons should not have this trouble as well.

## What it does
We created a web application that connects students together. It is focused on 3 topics: hackathons, study groups, pickup sports. It will connect like minded people together, and ultimately help people connect with others!

## How I built it
As a group who is experienced with python, we decided to use the flask framework and help us map out our web application. We have 3 different methods of connecting with people: Hackathons, sports, or study meetups.

## Challenges I ran into
At first, we wanted to use Django to handle our backend and have that linked with the frontend. We later switched to flask because it is much easier to navigate and have more control over what we're doing.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We have a security login feature that will allow you to create multiple users, and log in with different accounts. We had many issues with obtaining data from the slack channels. We worked together to overcome these challenges, and ended up scraping user information, and their programming languages capabilities.

## What I learned
Learning to deal with JSON was new for one of the team members. It was the first time for all of us working with flask, and that brought upon learning a new language in a short amount of time.

## What's next for StudentLife
We are looking to create more than just 3 features. We want to implement finding people around you who want to meetup and get food, or even people to just hang out and connect with. Ultimately, we want to make this a multi purpose social app!
